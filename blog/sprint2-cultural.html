                    <p class="h">Long term goals and Career pathway</p>
                    <p>Having already had a successful career in aviation I see my new challenges laying ahead as a full stack web developer. After completing Dev Academy I would love to be able to attain employment as an entry level web dev and work my way up to gain more confidence and skill in my abilities. Ideally, a job with a small start-up where I have to learn and do everything myself would be great but maybe a larger company with lots of leadership around to guide me would be better…arg, too many options!</p>
                    <p>Eventually, I would love to be in the position where I can own my own web development business or at least work remotely for my company.</p>

                    <p class="h">Strengths and Limitations</p>
                    <p>I believe my strengths lay in being a great team player, communicator and reliable. My previous work life has taught me to share ideas and learn from others. There was also a culture of not focusing on the end product but what happened along the way so I could notice differences and go away to learn from these.</p>
                    <p>Like most people I think, I find it hard to talk about limitations. I know I can be impatient at times when trying to find a solution, especially around computers. From a very early age it has been a battle to ‘get the computer to do want I want’. Maybe that is why I decided to take the course, if you can’t beat em, join em.</p> 
                    <p>I have also been known to rush head on into tasks before reading the instructions thoroughly and taking longer than expected to finish because of this. I will attempt to turn a poor life habit around by slowing down, analysing the situation and then proceeding with a clear plan of what we need to do to deliver a project.</p>

                    <p class="h">Time Management/Asking for help</p>
                    <p>Time management has never been an issue for me with regards to making the time to do things. However, getting stuck and mulling over making every detail good is going to be a big challenge for me. No-one likes delivering an unfinished product and with our timeframes this may be a reality. I have already been changing the way to work using the timer by having more breaks than I usually would. I need to continue with this has each time I come back I have found new focus and a break through rather quickly.</p>
                    <p>If I need help I will call on the other cohort members via slack and in the classroom. Then my facilitator and other teachers that are available. My brother is in web development and I may be able to contact him for assistance if he is not busy already.</p>
                    <p>This is also a good point to mention that I will be heading to the hospital for a couple of visits during bootcamp which, unfortunately, I will not have much power to change. Plus having a baby mean other issues which I may need to be away to deal with. I will give the group as much notice as possible if I cannot make it to class.</p>

                    <p class="h">Expectations from the Facilitation Team</p>
                    <p>Help when it is required in the form of guidance towards the potential solutions. Clear instructions on how to proceed also. Keeping the learning interesting and an a level where it is a challenge but I do not drown!</p>
