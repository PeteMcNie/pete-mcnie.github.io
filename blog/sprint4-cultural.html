                <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
                <div class="words">
                    <p class="h">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</p>
                    <p>The main overriding principle of neuroplasticity is that when we learn we are actually creating new pathways in our brain. 
                        This ability to create new pathways does not end when we leave childhood, as previously believed, but the brain continues to adapt 
                        and develop throughout our lives. </p>
                    <p>Knowing that the brain has this neuroplasticity enables us to gain a growth mindset. This growth mindset is the knowledge 
                        that we actually get smarter or more skilled by a sustained effort at trying to learn something.</p>
                    <p>By understanding the principles of neuroplasticity we know that we can influence our brains' ‘growth’ and how it learns. 
                        This means that we know that if we keep searching for answers and struggling through the hard bit of learning, we know we are 
                        actually strengthening our brains’ pathways and are more likely to keep trying to learn when the going gets tough instead of giving up.</p>
                    
                    <p class="h">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity.</p>
                    <p>A few methods of learning have been shown to enhance our brains’ neuroplasticity are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Traveling</li>
                        <li>Learning a musical instrument</li>
                        <li>Non-dominant hand exercises</li>
                        <li>Reading fiction</li>
                        <li>Expanding your vocabulary</li>
                        <li>Sleeping</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Every time we carry out a repetition of these activities, and more, we reinforce the pathway in our brain which in turn changes the 
                        way our brain works. As these pathways grow what is at first, a struggle, becomes easier as the pathway to that area in the brain 
                        is stronger. This leads us from the beginnings of learning a skill, by forming the pathways for the first time, to the automatic flow 
                        of thinking using strong established pathways in the brain.</p>

                        <p class="h">Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</p>
                        <p>I have been not only learning how to code by coding itself but also reading and talking about coding which makes me access 
                            those areas in my brain in different ways to strengthen the pathways that are forming. </p>
                        <p>For example, using the words used by people in the industry and using git to access files instead of the Finder/Home button are 
                            tactics that help strengthen pathways and embed the learning from previous weeks.</p>
                        <p>My favourite method of building brain strength has got to be sleeping however. A great nights rest can lead to things ‘clicking’ the next day.</p>

                <h4>The Growth Mindset</h4>
                <div class="words">
                    <p class="h">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</p>
                    <p>The growth mindset is us personally understanding that we can get smarter and more talented through the time and effort we put in. 
                        It is the opposite from the fixed mindset which tells us that it does not matter how much effort we put in we will never be smart or talented enough.</p>
                    <p>Knowing and believing that you growth mindset will lead you to approach learning with completely different behaviour. You will put 
                        more effort into learning because you know that at some point you will figure your problem out. You will end up putting more time and 
                        effort in to find the answer and end up strengthening those internal brain pathways far more than someone who gives up straight away.</p>
                    <p> With a growth mindset, individuals may achieve more than others because they are worrying less about seeming smart or talented and 
                        putting more of their energy into learning.</p>

                    <p class="h">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</p>
                    <p>I must admit this was not a new concept to me but how much information I found and studies done around both neuroplasticity and the 
                        growth mindset was a surprise. I did not realise some of the things I currently already do were actually good for maintaining the growth
                         mindset. Being curious and taking on challenges (like this course) as well as well as doing what I love has made me learn far more than
                          when I was at school and not interested.</p>
                    <p>I related to Jo$eph’s first youTube video for Sprint 4 when he was talking about not being great at maths initially at school but then 
                        he came back to it on his terms and needed bits of complex math with his coding. Because it was on Jo$eph’s terms and he loves coding 
                        the math was a small part of a bigger problem that was not going to stand in his way to finding the answers he was looking for.</p>
                    <p>It reminds me to keep on learning and searching for answers and to be curious to the ‘why’ and ‘how’ things are happening as these are 
                        where the learning is taking place. Not just the end answer being right.</p>

                    <p class="h">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>
                    <p>I think personally I could really stop and go over my results to add another element to my learning. I have found at the end of the day 
                        when I step away from the computer and stop doing what I am doing my brain has time to catch up and sometimes the solutions have come to me.
                         I could try doing this at the end of an exercise or section to make sure I have understood it fully and give the learning time to sink in.</p>
