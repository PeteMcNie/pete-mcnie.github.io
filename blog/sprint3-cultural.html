                    <p class="h">What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
                    <p>EQ is both an intelligence that lets us understand other peoples emotions and motivations and, a form of self reflection where we are able to look at ourselves and understand our own emotions and what is driving us.</p>
                    <p>On the understanding other people side of the coin, high EQ will show as having a higher amount of empathy for other people. Understanding why they are doing what they are doing and their motivations can lead us to work far better with them as a team. It is the ability to not only read the situation but to read the people you are working with and then adapt your information or work style to help everyone achieve to a higher standard. More formally this is called social skills and is the real bread and butter of teamwork.</p>
                    <p>Summary: A higher EQ means you will read situations and people better and know how to communicate on a level that is understandable for those you are working with. By understanding yourself and your own abilities you will not only be better placed to deal with challenges you will face, but you will be better at keeping those negative thoughts at bay. Knowing where your breaking points are you will be able to ask for guidance before you reach them, and be better at communicating what sort of help you need.</p>

                    <p class="h">How is it different from IQ?</p>
                    <p>IQ is your raw intelligence, your ability to solve problems. This is different from EQ in that IQ does not involve other people or account for how we interact with others. You could have a very high IQ and be able to solve the trickiest of problems but if you also had a low EQ you may not be able to communicate your answers with others clearly. A break down in communication could threaten the solutions that you have made.</p>

                    <p class="h">Why is it important?</p>
                    <p>In today’s society and with our modern workplaces we are likely to find ourselves working in teams, wether they are small, such as one-on-one, or large, such as a big corporate office. Our ability to read people and get our message across is always important. Having a high EQ leads us to not only be confident of our place in a team, but how to communicate and interact with the team to hear what is being asked of us and know when we have something important to add. </p>
                    <p>Critically it is very hard to gain IQ points ie: be smarter but it is possible to learn and practice your own EQ to raise it to a high standard. Over time someone with low EQ is able to train their mind to process their own internal thoughts and emotions as well as understand other people. Put together, as a persons EQ is increased their ability to increase it further will grow as they become more and more aware of themselves and others. </p>
                    <p>This ability to work well in teams and understand when you will require help is something recruiters look for when hiring new staff. They know at the end of the day the job is not ‘rocket science’ so the smartest (IQ that is) person is not required to fulfil the position.</p>
                    <p>A person with high EQ that does not know how to do the job yet will more likely be a better ‘fit’ for the business and get along really well with the other team members. This will in turn make them more trainable and engaged in the business itself as they will have more emotional investment in the company and its people.</p>
