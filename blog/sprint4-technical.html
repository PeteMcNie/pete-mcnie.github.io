                        Super_FizzBuzz is actually relatively simple once you break it down into small steps but is that what I did
                        to start? No, of course not. I tired to solve the problem staight away like a gun-slinging cowboy rolling into 
                        town. This approach got me a bit of code and then stuck at a point where I could not figure out how to move
                        forward. Attempt number one finished and 30 minutes gone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tired some pseudocode, but I think there must be a knack to writing <em>good</em> pseudocode. I wrote out 
                        the steps I thought I needed to take, and then followed them but to no avail. The solutions would not result and 
                        even though a I tired cutting and pasting bits of code and changing wording around it just would not work. If only
                        my pseudocode <em>actually</em> worked...I mean, I had written exactly what needed to happen. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started googling and improving my code from here. I saw a way to get numbers that were divisible by another
                        number with a remainder of zero, genius. From here I was able to stratch some code together that looked like it 
                        would work! Why won't it work! What's going on? I've read through every line and I can tell you it's perfect...
                        a work of art, it must work! It's still not working! What the #@%^$@# is happening? It's getting late, I'm tired,
                        'just work...please' I begged...it was way too late. At bed time....mood: pretty deflated and annoyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a terrible nights sleep I woke up and crawled back to my perfect-but-not-working code. Yup, still perfect,
                        still broken. Re-read the question and error messages. Return a "FizzBuzzed" array...yes that's what I'm...oh,
                        there's no return statement, doh...I think we can see how I felt and know the lessons I learnt from this.

                    <p>
                        I am not sure I have been solving any problems in an elegant way, if we are looking at problems I thought the solution
                        was awesome to, then the answer I found to the removeOdds question in the JS Olympics was a break through for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After reading through documentation on MDN and at Stack Overflow earlier in the week doing other kata questions I 
                        found I was confident with my solution and I was starting to really click what the code was doing better. It took 
                        a relatively sort amount of time for me to solve compared to other questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I found the process ran much smoother for me than it had earlier and could feel my confidence grow when the answer 
                        came back correct. I had one of those, 'I think I know what I'm doing moments'. The key learning was that if I keep struggling
                        to get my head around it, some of it will stick eventually.

                        As you may have read above I think there must be a knack to writing good pseudocode, a knack I do not have 
                        just yet. Over time I think this skill will become more valuable as my understanding of how to talk and think 
                        a bit more code grows.

                        My sweet bread and butter, come to me. I am great at giving it a go and trying to see if something works. Can

                        I have been making an effort to really read the messages and have had some advice on how to interpret them.
                        Like pseudocode I believe this one will get better with practice...in saying that however, I am off to a promising 
                        start.

                        I love the console.log method. Great for inserting here there and everywhere so I can see what is happening with 
                        the code. Highly recommend this to anyone else new that is trying to keep track of what is going on.

                        Talking the problem out has helped me solve the issues I am having but I have been talking to my brother who is in 
                        web developement rather than the cohort via slack. During the looping exercises with cohort memebers we did discuss other parts 
                        of the course and where we were up to.

                        I could have been better at asking for help when I needed it from the coaches but I feel this is a last solution if

                        Looking back and reflectiing on each part of the process has been great. This is something I have been encouraged to 
                        do throughout my career and has been vey helpful. By reflecting you have time to think over again what went right and 
                        what went wrong and think back to the reasons why. I believe this will make us all better coders as we will see when we
                        are 'clicking' and getting it right and grow in confidence from self-reflection.
