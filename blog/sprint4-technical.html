              <h4>Javascripts relationship to HTML and CSS</h4>
              <div class="words">
                <p>HTML (Hyper-text-markup-language) is the structure of your webpage. Think of it as the bones and muscles. HTML is a great starting point but not very exciting to look at.</p>
                <p>CSS (Cascading-style-sheet) is the styling or 'look' of your webpage. Think of CSS as the design we place on those bones and muscles. With CSS you can have millions of different designs and thats just in the color department. 
                  Thinking back to our bones and muscles, CSS gives us the ablility to change the size and shape of those muscles
                  as well as alter all sorts of other parts like the hair and eye color to create a person from those humble beginnings.

              <p>But wait, didn't we want to know what Javascripts relationship was with HTML and CSS? Now that we understand how HTML and CSS work together
                we can look at how Javascript interacts with them both but first we need to understand what the DOM is.

                  <p class="share-space-heading">The DOM (Document Object Model)</p>
                  <p>Firstly, your computer runs a certain type of browser to explore the internet. This could be safari, firefox or the popular google chrome. 
                    These browsers create a window for us to use. Inside of this window is a document or webpage is created by us, our webpage!
                  </p>
                  <p>The DOM is a representation of our HTML document that has elements arranged into the similar tree structure you see in your HTML.
                    It is through this DOM tree structure that we can add to, delete, edit. Each element (&lt;body&gt; or &lt;div&gt;) or attribute (class="time") 
                    we add in our code is a new NODE (or branch) in the DOM tree structure. What we see as elements & attributes etc the computer sees as NODES in the DOM.</p>

                  <p>This is where Javascript comes in. Using Javascript we can manipulate the NODES in the DOM, which we see as manipulation of the pieces of
                    data that make up our webpage, the elements and attributes etc.</p>
                  <p>If this this confusing to follow the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom" target="_blank">Tools for Web Developers</a> 
                    article from google explains the DOM in further detail and has a couple of great images at the bottom of the page.</p>
