                    <p>
                        Super_FizzBuzz is actually relatively simple once you break it down into small steps but is that what I did
                        to start? No, of course not. I tired to solve the problem staight away like a gun-slinging cowboy rolling into 
                        town. This approach got me a bit of code and then stuck at a point where I could not figure out how to move
                        forward. Attempt number one finished and 30 minutes gone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tired some pseudocode, but I think there must be a knack to writing <em>good</em> pseudocode. I wrote out 
                        the steps I thought I needed to take and then followed them but to no avail. The solutions would not log and 
                        even though a I tired cutting and pasting bits of code and changing wording around it would not work. If only
                        my pseudocode <em>actually</em> worked...I mean, I had written exactly what needed to happen. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started googling and improving my code from here. I saw a way to get numbers that were divisible by another
                        number with a remainder of zero, genius. From here I was able to stratch some code together that looked like it 
                        would work! Why won't it work! What's going on? I've read through every line and I can tell you it's perfect...
                        a work of art, it must work! It's still not working! What the #@%^$@# is happening? Ok, so at this point it was
                        bed time....needless to say I wasn't in a great mood going to bed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a terrible nights sleep I woke up and crawled back to my perfect-but-not-working code. Yup, still perfect,
                        still broken. Re-read the question and error messages. Return a "FizzBuzzed" array...yes that's what I'm...oh,
                        there's no return statement, doh...I think we can see how I felt and know the I learnt from this.

                    <p>
                        I am not sure I have been solving any problems in an elegant way, if we are looking at problems I thought the solution
                        was awesome to, then the answer I found to the removeOdds question in the JS Olympics was a break through for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After reading through documentation on MDN and at Stack Overflow earlier in the week doing other kata questions I 
                        found I was confident with my solution and I was starting to really click what the code was doing better. It took 
                        a relatively sort amount of time for me to solve compared to other questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I found the process ran much smoother for me than it had earlier and could feel my confidence grow when the answer 
                        came back correct. I had one of those, 'I think I know what I'm doing moments'. The key learning was that if I keep struggling
                        to get my head around it, some of it will stick eventually.
