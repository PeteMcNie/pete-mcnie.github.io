              <h4>Javascripts relationship to HTML and CSS</h4>
              <div class="words">
                <p>HTML (Hyper-text-markup-language) is the structure of your webpage. Think of it as the bones and muscles. HTML is a great starting point but not very exciting to look at.</p>
                <p>CSS (Cascading-style-sheet) is the styling or 'look' of your webpage. Think of CSS as the design we place on those bones and muscles. With CSS you can have millions of different designs and thats just in the color department. 
                  Thinking back to our bones and muscles, CSS gives us the ablility to change the size and shape of those muscles
                  as well as alter all sorts of other parts like the hair and eye color to create a person from those humble beginnings.

              <p>But wait, didn't we want to know what Javascripts relationship was with HTML and CSS? Now that we understand how HTML and CSS work together
                we can look at how Javascript interacts with them both but first we need to understand what the DOM is.

            <h4>The DOM (Document Object Model)</h4>
            <div class="share-space">
                <div class="words">
                  <p>Firstly, your computer runs a certain type of browser to explore the internet. This could be safari, firefox or the popular google chrome. 
                    These browsers create a window for us to use. Inside of this window a document or webpage is created by us, our webpage!
                  </p>
                  <p>The document is actually a DOM made up of 'NODES' to the computer. What we see as pieces of data such as elements 
                    (&lt;body&gt; or &lt;div&gt;) & attributes (class="time") etc the computer sees as NODES in the DOM.</p>

                  <p>This is where Javascript comes in. Using Javascript we can manipulate the NODES in the DOM, which we see as manipulation of the pieces of
                    data that make up our webpage, the elements and attributes etc.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="dom-model">
                  <figure>
                    <img src="#" atl="">
                    <figcaption></figcaption>

            <h4>How does Javascript interact with the DOM to alter our web page?</h4>
            <div class="words">
              <p>Using in-built methods that Javascript has, such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>.getElementsByTagName()</li>
                <li>.getElementsByClassName()</li>
                <li>.getElementsByID()</li>
                <li>.getElementsByName()</li>
                <li>.querySelector()</li>
                <li>.querySelectorAll()</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These methods (and more) can target a NODE, or multiple NODES and we can then alter the NODE in many different ways.
                In fact we can alter NODES in so many ways we do not have time to mention them all here but once Javascript is 
                targeting a NODE in the DOM we can add interactivity to our page such as adding events on mouse clicks, pop ups and auto-filling of forms etc.

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <div class="words">
              <p>In this way we can see that our HTML and CSS can be enhanced and altered by Javascript. This gives our boring page
                interactivity. Our initial person can be turned into a chef, banker, police officer or web developer. By making the web page 
                have special skills and being creative our web page can be turned into a unique experience for guests.
