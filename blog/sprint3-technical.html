              <h4>Javascripts relationship to HTML and CSS</h4>
              <div class="words">
                <p>HTML (Hyper-text-markup-language) is the structure of your webpage. Think of it as the bones and muscles. HTML is a great starting point but not very exciting to look at.</p>
                <p>CSS (Cascading-style-sheet) is the styling or 'look' of your webpage. Think of CSS as the design we place on those bones and muscles. With CSS you can have millions of different designs and thats just in the color department. 
                  Thinking back to our bones and muscles, CSS gives us the ablility to change the size and shape of those muscles
                  as well as alter all sorts of other parts like the hair and eye color to create a person from those humble beginnings.

              <p>But wait, didn't we want to know what Javascripts relationship was with HTML and CSS? Now that we understand how HTML and CSS work together
                we can look at how Javascript interacts with them both but first we need to understand what the DOM is.

                  <p class="share-space-heading">The DOM (Document Object Model)</p>
                  <p>Firstly, your computer runs a certain type of browser to explore the internet. This could be safari, firefox or the popular google chrome. 
                    These browsers create a window for us to use. Inside of this window is a document or webpage is created by us, our webpage!
                  </p>
                  <p>The DOM is a representation of our HTML document that has elements arranged into the similar tree structure you see in your HTML.
                    It is through this DOM tree structure that we can add to, delete, edit. Each element (&lt;body&gt; or &lt;div&gt;) or attribute (class="time") 
                    we add in our code is a new NODE (or branch) in the DOM tree structure. What we see as pieces of data such as elements 
                     & attributes etc the computer sees as NODES in the DOM.</p>

                  <p>This is where Javascript comes in. Using Javascript we can manipulate the NODES in the DOM, which we see as manipulation of the pieces of
                    data that make up our webpage, the elements and attributes etc.</p>
                  <p>If this this confusing to follow the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom" target="_blank">Tools for Web Developers</a> article from google explains the DOM in further detail.</p>

            <p class="h">How does Javascript interact with the DOM to alter our web page?</p>
            <div class="words">
              <p>Using in-built methods that Javascript has, such as:</p>
              <ul class="code">
                <li>.getElementsByTagName()</li>
                <li>.getElementsByClassName()</li>
                <li>.getElementsByID()</li>
                <li>.getElementsByName()</li>
                <li>.querySelector()</li>
                <li>.querySelectorAll()</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These methods (and more) can target a NODE, or multiple NODES and we can then alter the NODE in many different ways.
                In fact we can alter NODES in so many ways we do not have time to mention them all here but once Javascript is 
                targeting a NODE in the DOM we can add interactivity to our page such as adding events on mouse clicks, pop ups and auto-filling of forms etc.
              </p>
              <p>We can see that our HTML and CSS can be enhanced and altered by Javascript. This gives our page
                interactivity. Our initial designe can be turned into a chef, banker, police officer or web developer. Just like each of these 
                roles having special skills our web page can have unique skills and create a better experience for our guests.

            <h4>DevTools</h4>
            <p class="h">What are DevTools and how do they relate to the DOM?</p>
            <div class="words">
              <p>Chrome Developer Tools or Dev Tools as they are known, are found by right clicking on a web page and 
                selecting <strong>inspect</strong> from the list provided. The developer tools will open up with the Elements 
              heading selected at the top of the page. This is a list of elements that make up the DOM tree. It looks very similar 
            to our HTML however there are some differences.</p>
              <p>Using DevTools we can search for and select different NODES that make up our web page. From here we are able to edit the DOM directly 
                and see how those changes affect the web page in real time. Normally any changes we make are wiped the second we reload the web page 
                from the oringal source. However, we are able to give DevTools access to our web page files (if we have them) which makes any changes
                we make permanent. This is a handy tool for developers trying to alter their page and see results we real time.

            <div class="words">
              <p>Control flow is simply the order in which the computer will execute the code we have written. Code normally 
                runs from the first line to the last line, unless it runs across any type of code that alters the flow of
                the code such as conditionals and loops. These are types of control flow.

              <p>An example of control flow is an if....else statement. If one statement is true a specific set of code executes, otherwise (or else)
                another set of code will execute.
              </p>
              <p>Look at our example in figure 3. If milk is available in the fridge we will pour it on our cerial and have breakfast.
                Otherwise (or else), we will go to the shop and buy milk.

              <p>Loops are our way of doing the same action or command over and over again. In programming this is called iteration.</p>
              <p>If we have a piece of code that we need to run over and over again instead of wirting out that same code we can create 
                a loop which we can then designate to run as many times as we need it to.
              </p>

              <p>Lets say we decide to buy more than one bottle of milk once we are at the shop from our example above. A loop will keep 
                running until we have reached the number of milk bottles we need before leaving instead of just grabbing one.

                <p>Functions allow us to store a piece of our code inside a defined block. Inside the block is our function

            <div class="share-space">
              <div class="words">
                <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values inside a signle variable. Think of an array like a box. All the items
                  inside the box are indexed so we can find them. This index starts at 0 for the first item and 1 for the second and so on.
                </p>
                <p>Example: <p class="code">let myBox = ["lion", "grasshopper", "tiger", "teddy", "ant", "penguin"]<p></p>
                <p>To access our box and grab an item we first need to get the box and secondly, we then use <strong>bracket notation ([])</strong>
                  to find the item we want. Thinking back to our example lets say we wanted to find our teddy inside the box.
                </p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p class="code">myBox[3]</p>
                <p>We grabbed the box we created and then located our teddy inside the box using bracket notation. If you want to check 
                  this example you yourself you'll need to log the answer to your console. <span class="code">console.log(myBox[3]);</span>

                <p>Objects are very similar to arrays (in fact an array is a type of object) in that objects can be used to
                  store multiple variables. However, unlike an array, instead of each item being assigned an index number, objects 
                  have 'properties' or 'keys' and values. See figure 6.
                </p>
                <p>The difference for us accessing the object when compared to arraysis that we use <strong>dot notation or bracket notation</strong>. 
                  However, if there is a special character in the objects property/key then we must use bracket notation only. Specical charaters 
                include spaces, hyphens and more.</p>

                access our object using either dot or bracket notation and then use the arrays index via braket notation to get that item.</p>
