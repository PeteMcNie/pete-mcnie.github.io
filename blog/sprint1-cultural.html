                      Who am I? Seems like a bit of a strange question these days. With everything going on in the world I think we
                       can all be forgiven for pondering this question a bit and not quite being sure…I don’t think I know at the 
                       best of times. But this is my blog and this is the question that needs to be answered so in a round about way, 
                       here goes:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My son, Atlas, was born on the 2nd February 2020, quite a cool date actually, 02/02/2020 if you use numbers. This 
                      isn’t the only cool thing either, his Uncle Nigel, my brother is born on the 2nd February too…just a few years 
                      earlier. On the day of Atlas’s birth I had been feeling slightly off for a couple of months, nothing major, just 
                      a little dizzy sometimes while playing indoor football. I love indoor football and I suppose this is my first 
                      value for you. <strong class="keypoint">Commitment and teamwork</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I have played football since I was five and every time a game is about to start I get a rush, not knowing how the 
                      game is going to turn out and knowing that I can’t do it all myself has made it an extremely rewarding past time 
                      for me over the years. Putting the effort in so I do not let my team mates down and trying to solve the problem of 
                      getting the ball from my feet into the opposition’s goal has been great fun. I have been blessed throughout my life 
                      to have never had any major injuries that prevent me from playing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Anyway back to the story, my wife, Courtney, and I went to the doctor on the Friday before Atlas was born. Just to 
                      get this dizziness checked out I said…probably nothing but they may need to give me glasses for my work I thought. At 
                      that point in time I was a First Officer (pilot) with Air New Zealand. I had been with them since April 2019 so was 
                      still a little shy of a years’ employment. I have always been proud to say that I taught myself how to fly by self 
                      studying all the theory. <strong class="keypoint">While immensely difficult I now approach any challenge with the 
                        mindset that, if can teach myself how to fly I can learn anything</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My doctor was not happy with the dizziness and something wrong with my vision that she noticed. I was sent for an MRI 
                      that evening to see if there was something going on. On Saturday evening my doctor rang and told me the Neurologist at 
                      Auckland hospital wanted to talk to me. I remember we were at Courtney’s bosses’ house having a catch up, it was a 
                      beautiful, hot night and Courtney was suffering under the heat and having Atlas inside her belly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The next day the Neurologist rung at around 7:10am and asked if we could come in for 8:30am…that’s not exactly the 
                      phone call you want to hear when you first wake up. Courtney was already in the lounge having breakfast as she had been 
                      a bit uncomfortable in the night. We packed our overnight bags, as Atlas was close to his due date, and left for the 
                      hospital. I remember heading up to the Neurology ward on level 8 and waiting for the doctor to come. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Close to two hours later, with Courtney getting more and more uncomfortable, a doctor came and ran some tests and then 
                      disappeared. If there is one thing my job has taught me, it's to let experts in their field do their thing. Patience and 
                      taking your time to get it right is far better than rushing into mistake after mistake. Sometimes this takes a while but 
                      I would rather be waiting for the doctor to get it right than me to rush him or her and mistakes to creep in.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                      Once the doctor arrived he did not have very good news for me unfortunately. A bit stunned, I remember the doctor saying 
                      I had to stay at the hospital under watch until they were happy. Meanwhile Courtney had also absorbed the news and felt 
                      rather sick…in fact to the point she thought getting checked out in the maternity ward would be a good idea. Luckily this 
                      was just the level above on level 9. We went up and saw a midwife who happily started the process of checking on Courtney. 
                      10 minutes later and probably less than 2 hours after being told I had a major health issue we were informed that Courtney’s 
                      waters had broken and we would be having a baby that day! What. A. Day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Being given all this information made me realise something, we needed help. Our initial plan was for Atlas to arrive, then 
                      to settle into being parents before our parents came. We had too much on our plates and needed support. 
                      <strong class="keypoint">Knowing when to ask for help</strong> is a powerful skill. Years earlier, I had rung a friend to ask 
                      about how to become a pilot after I found myself doing a job that I did not enjoy. Now I rang both Courtney’s mum and my mum. 
                      They were both able to drop what they were doing, being a Sunday, and fly up from Wellington to Auckland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Every time I have found myself in a position of relative comfort in my life I have always looked for the next challenge. Maybe 
                      that is why about 6 months before this all happened, I had started looking into web development. I have always been curious 
                      about the work my brother, Nigel, and so many of my other friends do. I had even published a messy and very poor webpage to the 
                      internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once the dust settled I was able to think about what I wanted to do next… web development came straight back to the front of my 
                      mind. What is web development? Just because I can fly a plane doesn’t mean I’ll be any good at it…pilots are what we would call 
                      ‘users’, they operate the software. What would it take to be good enough to build the software? Not the software that planes 
                      operate with, but anything tech related…my first website was a mess but I was curious enough to want to learn more. I rang my 
                      brother, my cousin and my friends in the field…this is my chance to see!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      PS. On a side note COVID-19 helped give me a push by forcing Air New Zealand into a situation where they had to make some 
                      pilots redundant. I was one of those pilots. But instead of looking at this as a negative, they couldn’t do anything about 
                      the situation, I looked at it as a positive. You’ve been thinking about becoming a web developer more and more…how many more 
                      signs do you need from the universe that you should do this? Answer = none.
