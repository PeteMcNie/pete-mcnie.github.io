                    <h4>Foundations Core Skills</h4>
                    <div class="words">
                        <p class="h">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</p>
                        <p>
                            1 - After a decade in aviation pushing to achieve a life long dream I reached a point where I was happy and thought 
                            that I would retire another overweight pilot that got what I set out to achieve. But I learnt that the end goal was 
                            not what I was actually looking for, at times the journey felt too slow or had last time but I always made it through 
                            and yes, making it was great but the stories of how I got into my dream job are far better than the job itself. 
                            Embarking on this journey has reawakened the passion for learning something new again and being curious which I 
                            thought I had lost after so long. The core learning has helped me focus on being thankful for this opportunity to 
                            learn and grow again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2 - My ego…is a hard thing to talk about, sometimes it comes on strong and makes me feel confident in my knowledge 
                            and place in the world. It gives me the drive to never give up and know that my opinions are worth listening to. 
                            Sometimes it disappears and I feel like I have taken a huge gamble with my families time and that I really don’t know 
                            what I am doing. The core learning has highlighted that not only is this completely normal and that everyone is going 
                            through their own battles but that having the self awareness to understand these emotions is a strength not a weakness.
                             Everyone has taken on a huge challenge and even walking in the front door is an achievement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3 - That I have some of the core skills and knowledge to be successful in the tech industry. I know that as long as 
                            I keep true to myself and apply the lessons I have learnt over the years I will succeed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="h">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</p>
                        <p>
                            Programming and the tech industry are huge. There is so much to learn about so many different moving or updating parts. 
                            At the start you cannot be expected to know them all and I feel that in 10 or 20 years you may have a really good grasp 
                            on your chosen area of expertise and parts of programming that are associated with this but you will still be a beginner 
                            in other areas. This makes a persons values extremely important, why? Because we are all learning, even those experienced 
                            web developers that have been in the industry for years won’t have all the answers to how ‘everything’ works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is up to us to take responsibility for our learning. This is where self awareness really shows itself, how long do I 
                            stick at a challenge before asking google, a work colleague or friend? Do I let small problems stack up and go home deflated 
                            each day because I am crushed by the challenges I am going to face everyday? Being honest with yourself and your abilities is
                             hard skill to master but with great self awareness comes a great opportunity to learn and grow. Making those once hard 
                             challenges not so big after all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And lastly but most importantly, empathy will play a huge part in any industry where teamwork and shared knowledge are key. 
                            No one wants to work with the mad scientist that knows all the answers (or where to get them) and rubs your face in how smart 
                            they are. Teamwork, sharing and helping others will be major skills for us moving forward in the industry and how good you are 
                            at these skills depends on how empathetic you are towards others. Taking time to listen, share and adapt to colleagues and 
                            clients will help you complete projects that everyone is proud of and ultimately win business for you.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
                        <p>
                            The amount of similarities between the core learning and what aviation refers to as human factors. There is a huge amount of
                             cross over between the two and having done human factors training every year for the last decade I feel confident I understand
                             the basics regarding the core syllabus.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
                        <p>
                            Sharing personal information with others and opening out. While I may have been given and done similar things with aviation I 
                            never had to talk about them or open out to share what I have learn with other people. Up until now it has been, here is the 
                            information, take it home, have a read. Getting me to think back on information and share my personal experiences has been 
                            different…I might be guilty of over sharing, I get carried away sometimes once I start.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</p>
                        <p>
                            There are certain behaviours and skills potential employers and going to be looking for in everyone. Things like the drive to 
                            keep learning (growth mindset), the ability to work well in a team, even if the team is you and your clients in a small firm, 
                            and how well you communicate (listening and looping) and get along with others. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The core content is highlighting the fact that these skills are just as important for us getting our first job as our coding 
                            abilities may be. In fact, if the tech industry is anything like the aviation industry, I am sure that hiring will be done on 
                            the core skill firstly with the knowledge that if they find the right candidate they will train that person up to be the coder 
                            they want in due course.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="h">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </p>
                        <p>No, it feels like a refresher and also more in-depth look at some of the knowledge I already have. It also serves as a reminder 
                            that some of the skills from my past will be very useful moving forward.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer</p>
                        <p>
                            I was wondering that at the start especially when I knew how challenging weeks 3 and 5 were going to be but I have found there 
                            is only so much coding I can do before my head starts to explode and I need a break. The coding will come with time and practice 
                            and doing a little bit every day rather than having to climb a huge wall of coding <em>every</em> has been a good learning curve.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
                        <p>
                            The skills I am really hoping to attain are a good base level understanding of Javascript and knowledge of ‘how’ web development 
                            teams (or individuals) work to produce their results. This is a completely different environment to what I have been used to in 
                            the past , I am nervous and excited to see how it works. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I have mentioned previously, I would love to become a full stack web developer over time as I feel a good grounding in the 
                            whole process will set me up for the future if I manage to make it to the dizzy heights of self-employment. In the short term, 
                            learning as much as possible everyday and then gaining a first start to keep building my skills is the aim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Long term I want to be able to use my knowledge to help those that may not be able to afford a web page at market rates and 
                            keep developing skills to explore new options such as making games etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="h">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</p>
                        <p>
                            My impatience with computers is definitely being softened as I learn to live and deal with the blocks that pop up while working. 
                            I have found understanding what is going on by use of console.log and reading error messages has help tremendously. Getting stuck 
                            and not knowing what just happened is very frustrating and these skills along with a bit of patience have helped me find the 
                            challenge of finding a solution rewarding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I do still believe that my strengths of communication, reliable and being a team player will be my biggest strengths going into 
                            bootcamp. I know when to ask for help and have been getting better at ‘knowing’ what is going on which should make the transition 
                            into bootcamp easier than it would have been five weeks ago. In saying that I do need to be careful that I do not go asking for 
                            help every ten seconds…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I understand I am new to web development and I am going to have to listen and learn not just from facilitators but also my fellow 
                            students as well. The opportunity to learn is going to be great I just need to make sure I am soaking everything so I can keep improving. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</p>
                        <p>
                            I think for me it will be the balance between home and bootcamp life. My wife and I have a four month old (at the start of bootcamp) and 
                            I am sure this is going to make juggling the course load more difficult than it would have been a  little while ago. In the short 
                            time we have had a baby we have learnt that any schedule or structure for your day or week is hard to maintain as there is always a 
                            curve ball being thrown into the mix. This could make finishing projects hard as I may need time away to deal with home life. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</p>
                        <p>
                            I am really interested in developing a structured approach to how projects are attempted. My personal style has been just to choose a 
                            point to go in on and start working. This works okay for someone who is working on something by themselves but I want my developing 
                            technique to be understandable and relatable for other people that I am working with. By working in a structured manner I will lay a 
                            strong foundation for others to understand where I am up to and pick up my work if I am not available to complete it.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</p>
                        <p>
                            From the foundations material I know that uncle google is always available and there are many other problem solving techniques at my 
                            disposal. Based on the amount of time I have been given for a task and how big the task is will inform how soon I go looking for help. 
                            I am confident enough not to whittle away precious time if swallowing my pride and getting assistance is going to get the ball moving 
                            in the right direction. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While on bootcamp I know I will not only have my fellow cohort members to discuss course material, but there will also be access to 
                            facilitators to assist with any areas I am coming stuck on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To work productively and safely with all other members in the dev academy environment I will follow staff member instructions (as 
                            long as they don’t cause harm physical or mental) and listen to and work in collaboration with my cohort members. Taking time to see 
                            how team members are feeling and any issues that we have as a group will help me work with team members productively.

                            Workload management should hopefully not be an issue for me. I am invested in the course and will happily work weekends and overtime 
                            to make sure I am where I need to be.
