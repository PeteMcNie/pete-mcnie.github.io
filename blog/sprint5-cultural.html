                    <h4>Foundations Core Skills</h4>
                    <div class="words">
                        <p class="h">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</p>
                        <p>
                            1 - After a decade in aviation pushing to achieve a life long dream I reached a point where I was happy and thought 
                            that I would retire another overweight pilot that got what I set out to achieve. But I learnt that the end goal was 
                            not what I was actually looking for, at times the journey felt too slow or had last time but I always made it through 
                            and yes, making it was great but the stories of how I got into my dream job are far better than the job itself. 
                            Embarking on this journey has reawakened the passion for learning something new again and being curious which I 
                            thought I had lost after so long. The core learning has helped me focus on being thankful for this opportunity to 
                            learn and grow again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2 - My ego…is a hard thing to talk about, sometimes it comes on strong and makes me feel confident in my knowledge 
                            and place in the world. It gives me the drive to never give up and know that my opinions are worth listening to. 
                            Sometimes it disappears and I feel like I have taken a huge gamble with my families time and that I really don’t know 
                            what I am doing. The core learning has highlighted that not only is this completely normal and that everyone is going 
                            through their own battles but that having the self awareness to understand these emotions is a strength not a weakness.
                             Everyone has taken on a huge challenge and even walking in the front door is an achievement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3 - That I have some of the core skills and knowledge to be successful in the tech industry. I know that as long as 
                            I keep true to myself and apply the lessons I have learnt over the years I will succeed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="h">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</p>
                        <p>
                            Programming and the tech industry are huge. There is so much to learn about so many different moving or updating parts. 
                            At the start you cannot be expected to know them all and I feel that in 10 or 20 years you may have a really good grasp 
                            on your chosen area of expertise and parts of programming that are associated with this but you will still be a beginner 
                            in other areas. This makes a persons values extremely important, why? Because we are all learning, even those experienced 
                            web developers that have been in the industry for years won’t have all the answers to how ‘everything’ works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is up to us to take responsibility for our learning. This is where self awareness really shows itself, how long do I 
                            stick at a challenge before asking google, a work colleague or friend? Do I let small problems stack up and go home deflated 
                            each day because I am crushed by the challenges I am going to face everyday? Being honest with yourself and your abilities is
                             hard skill to master but with great self awareness comes a great opportunity to learn and grow. Making those once hard 
                             challenges not so big after all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And lastly but most importantly, empathy will play a huge part in any industry where teamwork and shared knowledge are key. 
                            No one wants to work with the mad scientist that knows all the answers (or where to get them) and rubs your face in how smart 
                            they are. Teamwork, sharing and helping others will be major skills for us moving forward in the industry and how good you are 
                            at these skills depends on how empathetic you are towards others. Taking time to listen, share and adapt to colleagues and 
                            clients will help you complete projects that everyone is proud of and ultimately win business for you.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
                        <p>
                            The amount of similarities between the core learning and what aviation refers to as human factors. There is a huge amount of
                             cross over between the two and having done human factors training every year for the last decade I feel confident I understand
                             the basics regarding the core syllabus.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
                        <p>
                            Sharing personal information with others and opening out. While I may have been given and done similar things with aviation I 
                            never had to talk about them or open out to share what I have learn with other people. Up until now it has been, here is the 
                            information, take it home, have a read. Getting me to think back on information and share my personal experiences has been 
                            different…I might be guilty of over sharing, I get carried away sometimes once I start.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</p>
                        <p>
                            There are certain behaviours and skills potential employers and going to be looking for in everyone. Things like the drive to 
                            keep learning (growth mindset), the ability to work well in a team, even if the team is you and your clients in a small firm, 
                            and how well you communicate (listening and looping) and get along with others. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The core content is highlighting the fact that these skills are just as important for us getting our first job as our coding 
                            abilities may be. In fact, if the tech industry is anything like the aviation industry, I am sure that hiring will be done on 
                            the core skill firstly with the knowledge that if they find the right candidate they will train that person up to be the coder 
                            they want in due course.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="h">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </p>
                        <p>No, it feels like a refresher and also more in-depth look at some of the knowledge I already have. It also serves as a reminder 
                            that some of the skills from my past will be very useful moving forward.
                        </p>

                        <p class="h">Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer</p>
                        <p>
                            I was wondering that at the start especially when I knew how challenging weeks 3 and 5 were going to be but I have found there 
                            is only so much coding I can do before my head starts to explode and I need a break. The coding will come with time and practice 
                            and doing a little bit every day rather than having to climb a huge wall of coding <em>every</em> has been a good learning curve.
                        </p>
